\section{Introduction}\label{S:1}
%The text of this section.
Write a brief description (background/significance) of what the project is about. ====== Fractals are interesting and arguably beautiful representations of the 


\section{Problem Statement and Assumptions}\label{S:2}
%The text of this section. 
State fully and precisely the mathematical problem. 
State any assumptions made for the formulation of the model. 
Explain meaning of all symbols used. Make clear what is given and what we are looking for. 

\subsection{Newton Method for Root Finding}\label{S:2.1}
%
Text introducing this subsection. 
In (INSERT YEAR HERE) Sir Iaasic Newton developed a method for determining the roots of an equation. The pretense is: given an equation and an initial guess, you 

\subsection{Fractals from Newton Iterations}\label{S:2.2}
%
Text introducing this subsection.

\section{Method/Analysis}\label{S:3}
%Text introducing this section
Begin with naming or characterizing the method/approach to be used, perhaps explain the basic idea behind it, to what type of problems it applies, under what conditions, what it achieves, what are its main features, advantages, disadvantages. Justify why it is applicable to this problem, stating clearly any assumptions you need to make about the problem for the method to apply. Name some other methods/approaches one could use, and if/why your method may be preferable.


\section{Solutions/Results}\label{S:4}
%Text introducing this section
The guess for the root of the function converges onto the true root within 6 iterations when using the Newton Method. Conversely, the bisection method requires 37 iterations to converge. This shows that for the function \[F(x)=x^3+x^2-3x-3\] the Newton method is able to find the root in 1/6th the time required by the bisection method.

\section{Discussion/Conclusions}\label{S:5}
%Text introducing this subsection
Interpret your solution physically, what we learn from it, comment on strengths and weaknesses of the solution method, any nice features you want to brag about, possible ways to improve it (e.g. how to make it more accurate, more efficient), as appropriate.
